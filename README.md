   - Ensure a seamless and accurate transfer of data from the source to Power BI.
   - Validate the imported data to confirm its completeness and correctness.
   - Set up data refresh schedules to keep the analysis up to date.

4. Data Cleaning:
   - Utilize DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions to clean and transform the data.
   - Remove duplicate records, handle missing values, and resolve inconsistencies.
   - Standardize data formats, units, and variables to ensure consistency across the analysis.
   - Perform data validation checks to ensure the integrity of the dataset.

5. Data Processing:
   - Apply various data processing techniques, such as filtering, aggregation, and calculation, to derive meaningful insights.
   - Use DAX functions to perform calculations, such as year-on-year growth, percentage change, and averages.
   - Segment the data based on relevant criteria, such as accident severity, vehicle type, road type, location, and time.

6. Data Modeling:
   - Design and develop data models that best represent the relationships between different data entities.
   - Create relationships between tables based on common attributes to enable accurate analysis.
   - Define measures and calculated columns to facilitate efficient and accurate reporting.
   - Optimize the data model for improved performance and scalability.

7. Data Visualization and Chart Design:
   - Utilize Power BI's visualization capabilities to create visually appealing and informative charts and graphs.
   - Select appropriate chart types based on the nature of the data and the insights to be conveyed.
